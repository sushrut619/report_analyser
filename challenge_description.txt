Python Programming Exercise

Below is the programming task we would like you complete.

Your task is to write some code/script to analyze a report that we get from our partners
that lists various events that happen to units.

An example file looks like:

SHIP 123456789012347 ABC
  123 screen
  124 power
RECV 123456789012347 XYZ
   27 camera

The format for each record is:
<EVENT> <IMEI> <SKU>
  <FAULT_CODE> <FAULT_DESCRIPTION>

The 'EVENT' is either 'SHIP' or 'RECV'.  (NOTE:  SHIP = SEND)
SHIP means that the partner shipped the unit out of their warehouse
RECV means that the partner received the unit into their warehouse.

- 'IMEI' is a unique identifier for the device
  see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity for more information.

  There should be a 15-digit IMEI and have a valid check digit (see check digit computation).

  Records with invalid IMEIs should be reported, but otherwise ignored.

- 'SKU' is a stock-keeping unit that identifies the make/model of the unit.
   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_keeping_unit
  
- 'FAULT CODE' is an integer code describing the fault the device has.
- 'FAULT DESCRIPTION' is a string description the fault.

1. Write a Python script that will take an input file and is able to parse the input file and report on the following:

Provide the total number of devices that are currently at the partner, by SKU.

Assume the events in the file represent all events that have ever occurred.
E.g.:
Inventory:
ABC 1
XYZ 50

Provide a list of invalid records that are in the file including:
why they are invalid.
the record index.

E.g.: Invalid records:  5 Invalid IMEI, 10 Invalid event

Provide a list of all the “Fault Codes” and their “Faults”  

Output what the mapping is.
E.g.:
Fault code mapping:
 123 screen
 124 power
  27 camera

The script can use any Python standard library.

2. Design an SQL schema to store the data (i.e.: write the 'CREATE TABLE' DDL commands).

Please send this back to us when you have time. I think you should allow a couple of hours.
